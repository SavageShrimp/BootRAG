      "content": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to change the function so that the processed_text includes the name concatenated with a space. Let me see the original code. \n\nThe function is called process_file. It receives a JSON data which includes 'name' and 'text'. It processes the text and returns a JSON with 'text' as 'Processed text chunks'. The task is to modify it to include the name in the processed text, like \"Processed text chunks - Name\".\n\nHmm, I see that in the original code, processed_text is a string. So, I need to add the name to it. The name is extracted from data.get('name'). \n\nSo, I should change processed_text to be something like f\"{processed_text} - {name}\". That way, the name is appended with a space and a dash.\n\nWait, the original processed_text is 'Processed text chunks', so the new string should be \"Processed text chunks - Name\".\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I'll add the name to the processed_text string, ensuring there's a space before the name, perhaps using an f-string for clarity.\n\nI'll update the code accordingly, making sure the return statement includes the new concatenated string.\n</think>\n\nTo modify the function to include the name in the processed text, we'll update the processed_text string to concatenate the name. Here's the revised function:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/process', methods=['POST'])\ndef process_file():\n    data = request.get_json()\n    name = data.get('name')\n    text = data.get('text')\n    try:\n        pipeline.store_chunks(name, text)\n        processed_text = f'Processed text chunks - {name}'\n        return jsonify({'text': processed_text})\n    except Exception as e:\n        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500\n```\n\nIn this version, the processed_text now includes the name appended with a space and a dash, making the response more descriptive."
