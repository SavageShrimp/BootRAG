      "content": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out why my call to self.llm.invoke isn't returning any text when I have this custom callback handler. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the CustomCallbackHandler is a class I defined. It has several methods: on_message, on_error, raise_error, and ignore_llm. The on_message method prints the message, and on_error does the same for errors. The raise_error method also prints an error, and ignore_llm returns False. \n\nI'm using this custom callback handler with the CallbackManager from LangChain. The CallbackManager is responsible for handling various callback events during the execution of the language model. \n\nSo when I call self.llm.invoke(), it's supposed to process the input and return an output. But I'm not getting any text back. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about how the CallbackManager works. The CallbackManager is a context manager that handles callbacks, and it's used to manage the flow of the execution, especially with asynchronous processing. \n\nI remember that when using the CallbackManager, the setup is typically something like:\n\ncallbacks = [CustomCallbackHandler()]\nmanager = CallbackManager(callbacks=callbacks)\nself.llm = LlamaCpp( ... callbacks=manager ... )\n\nWait, maybe I missed something in the setup. Let me check.\n\nI think the problem is that I'm not properly initializing the CallbackManager with my custom handler. Maybe I need to pass the callbacks correctly.\n\nIn the code, I have:\n\nclass CustomCallbackHandler:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def on_message(self, message: str) -> None:\n        print(message)\n\n    def on_error(self, error: str) -> None:\n        print(f\"Error: {error}\")\n\n    def raise_error(self, error: str) -> None:\n        print(f\"Error: {error}\")\n\n    def ignore_llm(self) -> bool:\n        return False\n\nThen, in the code where I'm using it, I have:\n\ncallbacks = [CustomCallbackHandler()]\nmanager = CallbackManager(callbacks=callbacks)\nself.llm = LlamaCpp( ... callbacks=manager ... )\n\nSo, the manager is correctly set up with my custom handler.\n\nBut when I call self.llm.invoke(), maybe I'm not getting any output. Is it because I need to call it within a specific context, like using the manager as a context manager?\n\nAh, right! The CallbackManager is a context manager, so I should use it with a with statement. So, when I call self.llm.invoke(), I should wrap it with the manager.\n\nSo, perhaps I should modify my code to:\n\nwith manager:\n    response = self.llm.invoke(...)\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the CallbackManager is designed to handle the callbacks within its context, so the on_message method will be called when the model is processing.\n\nWait, let me think again. So when I use the manager as a context manager, it ensures that the callbacks are properly handled during the model's execution.\n\nSo, the issue is that I'm not using the manager as a context manager when calling invoke. So, the model's process is happening, but the callback isn't being triggered because I'm not within the with block.\n\nSo, the fix is to wrap the invoke call with the manager. That way, the on_message method is called when the model processes the input, and the output is returned correctly.\n\nSo, in my code, I should change:\n\nresponse = self.llm.invoke(...)\n\nto\n\nwith manager:\n    response = self.llm.invoke(...)\n\nThat should fix the issue.\n\nLet me summarize: The problem is that the model's invoke method wasn't being called within the context of the CallbackManager, so the on_message method wasn't being triggered, and the text wasn't being returned.\n\nBy adding the with manager: context, the callback is now properly handled, allowing the model to process and return the output.\n</think>\n\nTo resolve the issue where the `self.llm.invoke()` call wasn't returning any text, the `CallbackManager` should be used within a context manager to ensure that the custom callback handler is correctly invoked. Here's the solution:\n\n```python\nclass CustomCallbackHandler:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def on_message(self, message: str) -> None:\n        print(message)\n\n    def on_error(self, error: str) -> None:\n        print(f\"Error: {error}\")\n\n    def raise_error(self, error: str) -> None:\n        print(f\"Error: {error}\")\n\n    def ignore_llm(self) -> bool:\n        return False\n\n# Then, when using the callback manager:\n\ncallbacks = [CustomCallbackHandler()]\nmanager = CallbackManager(callbacks=callbacks)\nself.llm = LlamaCpp( ... callbacks=manager ... )\n\n# And when calling the model:\n\nwith manager:\n    response = self.llm.invoke(...)\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Problem Identification:** The `self.llm.invoke()` method wasn't returning any text, indicating that the callback wasn't being triggered.\n\n2. **Solution:** Use the `CallbackManager` as a context manager to ensure the custom handler is called during the model's execution.\n\n3. **Code Adjustment:** Wrap the `invoke()` call with `with manager:` to activate the callback context.\n\n4. **Outcome:** The `on_message` method in `CustomCallbackHandler` will now print the message, and the text will be returned as expected.\n\nBy using the `with` statement, the `CallbackManager` ensures that the custom callback handler processes the message during the model's execution."

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI need to provide a complete example that includes the custom callback handler, the setup with CallbackManager, and the usage of the model within the context manager.\n\nIn the previous explanation, I mentioned that the user should wrap the model's invoke call with the manager using a with statement. Now, I'll provide a complete code snippet that demonstrates this setup.\n\nI'll make sure to include the class definition and the usage in the code so that the user can see the entire picture.\n\nI should structure the code to show how everything is connected and works together. That way, the user can clearly see how the custom callback is integrated and how it affects the model's response.\n\nLet me make sure the code is clear and concise, highlighting the key parts like the custom class, the manager setup, and the usage of the context manager.\n\nI think that's a good approach. Now, I'll put it all together in a code block to make it easy to understand.\n</think>\n\nHere is a complete code example that demonstrates the custom callback handler with the `CallbackManager`:\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.callbacks import CallbackManager\nfrom langchain.schema import LlamaCpp\n\nclass CustomCallbackHandler:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def on_message(self, message: str) -> None:\n        print(message)\n\n    def on_error(self, error: str) -> None:\n        print(f\"Error: {error}\")\n\n    def raise_error(self, error: str) -> None:\n        print(f\"Error: {error}\")\n\n    def ignore_llm(self) -> bool:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage:\ncallbacks = [CustomCallbackHandler()]\nmanager = CallbackManager(callbacks=callbacks)\n\n# Assuming you have a model, for example, LlamaCpp:\nself.llm = LlamaCpp(\n    model_path=\"your-model-path\",  # Replace with your model path\n    callbacks=manager\n)\n\n# Now, when you call the model, use the manager as a context manager:\nwith manager:\n    response = self.llm.invoke(\"your input here\")  # Replace with your input\n    print(response)\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Code:**\n\n1. **CustomCallbackHandler Class:**\n   - Contains methods for handling messages and errors.\n   - The `on_message` method prints the message, and `on_error` prints errors.\n\n2. **CallbackManager Setup:**\n   - `callbacks = [CustomCallbackHandler()]` initializes the custom handler.\n   - `manager = CallbackManager(callbacks=callbacks)` creates the manager with the custom handler.\n\n3. **Model Initialization:**\n   - The model (e.g., LlamaCpp) is initialized with the `callbacks=manager`.\n\n4. **Using the Context Manager:**\n   - `with manager:` ensures that the custom handler is active during the model's execution.\n   - `response = self.llm.invoke(\"your input here\")` processes the input, and the custom handler is triggered.\n\n5. **Output:**\n   - The model's response is printed, and any messages or errors are handled by the custom handler.\n\nThis code example shows how the custom callback handler works with the `CallbackManager` and the model, ensuring that the `on_message` method is called when the model processes the input."

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe user provided their custom callback handler and used it with `CallbackManager`. The error suggests that the `CallbackManager` is being initialized with a `callbacks` argument, which it might not accept.\n\nI recall that in LangChain, the `CallbackManager` is initialized with `callbacks` as a parameter. But maybe in the version the user is using, the parameter name changed. Let me check.\n\nWait, I think that in newer versions, the `CallbackManager` uses `handlers` instead of `callbacks`. So the user is using `callbacks=callbacks`, which is no longer correct. The correct parameter is `handlers`.\n\nSo the solution is to change `callbacks=callbacks` to `handlers=callbacks` when initializing the `CallbackManager`.\n\nThat should fix the error because the `CallbackManager` expects `handlers`, not `callbacks`.\n\nLet me summarize the corrected code.\n</think>\n\nThe error occurs because the `CallbackManager` is being initialized with `callbacks`, but it expects `handlers` as the parameter name.

Wait, maybe the user is trying to use it correctly, but there's another issue.\n\nIn the user's code, they have `manager = CallbackManager(handlers=callbacks)`, and then they use `with manager:`. That should work because `CallbackManager` is a context manager.\n\nBut if they're still getting the error, perhaps they're using an older version of LangChain that doesn't support the context manager for `CallbackManager`.\n\nLet me check the LangChain documentation. Yes, in some versions, the `CallbackManager` can be used as a context manager, so using `with manager:` should be correct.\n\nWait, maybe the error is because the user is using the `CallbackManager` as a context manager, but perhaps in their version, it's not implemented that way.\n\nAlternatively, the error might be from another part of the code.\n\nLet me think of another approach.\n\nAnother way to use the `CallbackManager` is to pass it directly to the model without using the context manager.
