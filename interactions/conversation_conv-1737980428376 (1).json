But it seems like the tokens aren't being output individually as they're generated; instead, they all come out at once. Hmm, why could that be?\n\nMaybe I should look at how the generate_response method is implemented. Oh, wait, I just realized that the problem occurs because the call was to pipeline.generate_response and not pipeline.stream_response. That makes sense because generate_response might return the entire response at once instead of streaming it. So, I need to make sure I'm using the correct method that actually streams the tokens.\n\nBut what's the difference between generate_response and stream_response? I think generate_response might process the entire response first and then return it, which would explain why all tokens are output at once. On the other hand, stream_response is probably designed to yield tokens one by one as they're generated.\n\nSo, I need to modify the code to use stream_response instead of generate_response. But where is the stream_response method defined? Oh, it's in the RagPipeline class. Let me check that.\n\nLooking at the RagPipeline class, I see that the stream_response method is supposed to get the most similar chunks, format them, and then use the LLM's streaming capability to yield tokens individually. That sounds exactly like what I need.\n\nWait, but in the current code, the generate_response method is being used, which probably just returns the full response. I should change that to stream_response.\n\nLet me try that. I'll replace the call to generate_response with stream_response in the generate_response function. But I need to make sure that stream_response is correctly implemented and that it's actually yielding tokens one by one.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the Flask route is set up to handle streaming responses properly. The @stream_with_context decorator should be used to enable streaming in Flask. I think that's already in place, so that shouldn't be the issue.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the LlamaCpp model is configured correctly for streaming. The model should have streaming set to True, which it is in the current setup. So that's good.\n\nMaybe I should add some logging or print statements to see if the tokens are being generated individually by the stream_response method. If they are, but the Flask route isn't sending them out one by one, that would explain the issue.\n\nLet me add some debug statements. In the stream_response method, I'll print each token as it's yielded. If I'm seeing the tokens printed one by one, but the client isn't receiving them that way, then the problem might be in how the Flask route is handling the streaming.\n\nAlternatively, if the tokens aren't being printed individually, then the issue lies within the stream_response method itself. Maybe the generator isn't working as expected, or the method isn't correctly yielding the tokens.\n\nI should also check if there are any buffering issues. Perhaps the tokens are being buffered somewhere, and that's why they're only being output once the entire response is complete. I need to ensure that each token is sent immediately as it's generated.\n\nLet me think about how the tokens are being processed. The stream_response method should iterate over the generator and yield each token as soon as it's available. If that's not happening, maybe there's a bug in that method.\n\nI'll go ahead and make the necessary changes: replace generate_response with stream_response and verify that the tokens are being yielded correctly. Then, I'll test the application again to see if the streaming works as expected.\n\nIf I still face issues, I might need to look into the RagPipeline implementation to ensure that stream_response is correctly implemented and that it's compatible with the Flask streaming setup. Additionally, checking the network traffic or using browser developer tools to inspect the response might help identify if the tokens are being sent correctly but not being displayed properly.\n\nOverall, the main issue seems to be using the wrong method (generate_response instead of stream_response). By switching to the correct method and ensuring that tokens are yielded individually, the streaming should work as intended.\n</think>\n\nTo resolve the issue where tokens are not being streamed individually, we need to ensure that the correct method is used for streaming. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Correct Method**: The `generate_response` method likely returns the entire response at once, whereas the `stream_response` method is designed to yield tokens individually. Therefore, we need to use `stream_response` instead of `generate_response`.\n\n2. **Modify the Flask Route**: Update the `generate_response` function in your Flask application to call the `stream_response` method. This ensures that tokens are generated and sent one by one.\n\n3. **Implement the `stream_response` Method**: Ensure that the `RagPipeline` class has a properly implemented `stream_response` method. This method should:\n   - Retrieve the most similar chunks.\n   - Format these chunks appropriately.\n   - Use the LLM's streaming capability to yield tokens individually.\n\n4. **Enable Flask Streaming**: Use the `@stream_with_context` decorator in your Flask route to handle streaming responses correctly. This decorator allows the server to send data in chunks to the client.\n\n5. **Verify the Implementation**: Add debug statements or use logging to confirm that tokens are being generated and yielded individually by the `stream_response` method. This helps in identifying if the issue lies within the method itself.\n\n6. **Check for Buffering Issues**: Ensure that there are no buffers or accumulators that might cause tokens to be delayed or grouped together. Each token should be sent immediately as it is generated.\n\n7. **Test the Application**: After making the necessary changes, test the application to confirm that tokens are now being streamed individually to the client.\n\nBy following these steps, you should achieve real-time token streaming in your Flask application, ensuring that each token is output as soon as it is generated."
